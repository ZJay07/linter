## What is a linter?
"Lint is the computer science term for a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs. The term originates from a Unix utility that examined C language source code. A program which performs this function is also known as a "linter" " -- Wikipedia

Code issues can be detected by analysing its AST (Abstract Syxtax Tree)
